# Software-App
What it does: Gathers and suggests menus based on what restaurants you frequent and what food criteria you search for.
That way when your in a new location, the app can suggest a concise and taylored list of restaurants based on your
eating patterns.

Who is for: Anyone who enjoys eating out, they have food allergies, etc.

How it works: - Allow to continuously track your location and what restaurants you frequent. If you spend more than
15-20 mins in a stagnant location, the app will evaluate where you are. If you are in a restaurant, the app will pull 
information about that location and store it. You can Like or Dislike a specific location for specific reasons and 
that will help the app further taylor your settings. It would work with other food and search apps like Yelp and GrubHub to
follow and customize the your eating preferences.
